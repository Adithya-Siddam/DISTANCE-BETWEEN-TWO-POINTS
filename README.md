# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Create a python program to find the distance between two points.
### Step 2: 
get the co-ordinate values from user.
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  
![formula](/formula.jpg)
### Step 4: 
Display the output.
### Step 5: 
End the program.
### PROGRAM:
```

import numpy as np
p1=[10,6]
p2=[4,2]
distance=np.sqrt(((p1[0]-p2[0])**2)+((p1[1]-p2[1])**2))
print("{:.2f}".format(distance))
```
### OUTPUT:

### RESULT:
Thus the program to calculate distance between two points is calculated sucessfully.
